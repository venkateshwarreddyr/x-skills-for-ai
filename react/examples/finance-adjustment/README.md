# 💼 Financial Adjustment Approval — RAM Example

This example demonstrates a **real enterprise-grade use case** where RAM
outperforms traditional UI-driven systems and agent frameworks.

## 🧠 Problem This Solves

Financial adjustment workflows are:

- Compliance-heavy
- Multi-step
- Human + AI collaborative
- Audit-critical

Traditional dashboards fail to make decisions explicit.
Agent frameworks fail to make decisions safe.

RAM solves both.

## 🧩 What RAM Provides Here

- Deterministic state transitions
- Explicit allowed decisions
- AI-readable + human-readable context
- Runtime enforcement of compliance
- Full audit trail

## 🔁 How the Flow Works

1. Case enters `OPEN`
2. RAM renders decision surface (Markdown)
3. AI selects **one of the allowed actions**
4. Runtime enforces validity
5. Human can take over at any step
6. Every action is logged

No UI rewrites.  
No prompt hacking.  
No hallucinated transitions.

## 🤖 Example AI Decision

```json
{
  \"action\": \"EscalateToFinanceDirector\",
  \"reasoning\": \"High amount and high risk require senior approval\"
}
```

If invalid, RAM rejects it **before** state mutation.

## 🎯 When to Use RAM

This pattern excels in:

* Financial operations
* Trust & safety
* Incident response
* Compliance workflows
* Security access approvals

If correctness matters more than UI, RAM is the right layer.

## 🧠 Final Thought

> RAM is not an AI framework.
> It is a **decision surface** for AI and humans to safely share control.
